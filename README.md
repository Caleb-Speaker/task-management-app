## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Caleb-Speaker/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Auth0

1. Create an Auth0 account at [auth0.com](https://auth0.com)
2. Create a new **Single Page Application**
3. Add the following to the Application Settings:

**Allowed Callback URLs**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

http://localhost:3000
```

**Allowed Web Origins**

4. Enable **Offline Access** and **Refresh Token Rotation** in OAuth settings (if available)

### 4. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```

### 5. Start the development server

## ✍️ TypeScript & State Management

- All task data follows a strict `Task` interface.
- State is managed globally using a typed `TaskContext`.
- Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` are typed for safety.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Uses Auth0 (`@auth0/auth0-react`)
- Protected routes are displayed only to authenticated users.
- Logout returns the user to the home page.
